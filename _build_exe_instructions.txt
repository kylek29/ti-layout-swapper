To build an EXE you need to use PyInstaller. You may want to setup a separate vanilla virtual environment, if you use Anaconda 3 you can do this like:

conda create --no-default-packages -n 'pybase38tiswap' python=3.8.3
conda activate pybase38tiswap

pip install -U pywinauto
pip install pyinstaller
pip install argparse
pip install configparser

Then run from the script directory:
	
	pyinstaller --onefile tilayoutswap.py --icon tilayoutswap.ico



NOTE:
- Building from a base Anaconda environment can include every module that is installed and the resulting .EXE maybe hundreds of megs big. Doing a bare environment allows you to significantly reduce the size (for me it was reduced from 300mb to 14mb).
